And then they'll kill you.

You're dead, anyway.

For fuck's sake....

For fuck's sake, man.

Come on, man.

-On your knees. -No.

Please, don't kill me.

SATURDAY 12:30 PM Don't look at me.

Don't look at me.

-Please, don't. -Don't fucking look at me.

Don't fucking look at me.

What the hell was that?

26 HOURS OF ROBBERY What happened?

Calm down, Jesus!

Calm down. Have some fucking strength, or we won't get out alive, right? You have to give it some balls.

Thanks.

Shut up, shut up.

-Thanks. -Shut up.

Thanks. Tell them you killed me and you got rid of the body.

-I'll hide. -Where the fuck will you hide?

In vault 2.

I've got the fingerprint. Nobody will get in. I'll hide. Tell them you killed me.

-Tell them. -There's not a single drop of blood.

-There's not a single drop of blood. -Shoot me here, come on.

-Shoot me in the hand. -Don't talk nonsense.

-Shoot me. -For fuck's sake!

-In my shoulder. -The shoulder?

Shoot me in the shoulder.

The shoulder is so close to the lung. I can't do it.

In my thigh, it bleeds a lot. I've seen it.

My brother got hurt with an iron and he bled a lot. Come on. Come.

Bite my hand if you want.

Okay, okay.

Okay.

-Okay, okay. -No!

Two shots...

Have you got bad aim or do blondes get you nervous?

If she grabs your knee and begs you not to kill her, it's not easy.

Why didn't you kill her?

You're a fucking bastard.

You don't want to stain your hands with blood, but you stain mine.

If you ever touch me again, you're dead.

There's a coal boiler in the basement. Put her inside.

Later you'll clean all this.

Paula?

Paula, honey! Where are you?

Where are you, Paula?

Paula, honey!

Paula...

"Now I don't live in Almazأ،n. I live in Madrid.

The bus that goes downtown is number 21.

I've got two daughters. The keys are in a drawer in the hall.

I live with Raquel and Paula. My brother is sick.

The keys are... I've got two daughters. Raquel is...

Paula always has her way.

Paula's father has got a restraining order.

Never let Paula go with her father."

Hello?

Professor, the one hour term I gave you has finished.

I need to know if you're going to surrender.

When you were a child, what games did you play in the playground?

With... the jump rope, "hitting the can, the donkey...."

I played ladybirds too. I was very good at that.

"I played cops and robbers."

Is it familiar?

Some of us played cops and had to catch the others and when they got you, they got you, but I don't remember a single child in that playground who surrendered before he was caught.

Children in the school playground do not risk going to prison for 8 or 16 years.

You're right. You're absolutely right.

That's why I asked my mates.

"We voted, and you know what?"

We're enthusiasts.

Finally we've decided to go for the zero years in prison.

"Hello, it's Raquel. I can't answer right now.

If it's something urgent, leave a message after the beep."

A lot of people are suffering. What do you plan to do?

Take paper and a pen.

"I need a lorry" a 3-axle one, with a trailer for 18 tonnes, two more tankers, with propane gas to escort it and the ship Malaika with flag from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

Is it familiar? It's the one seized nine months ago with 2,800 kilos of cocaine.

It's docked at Ferrol's military port.

It'll won't be easy to get the green light to your requests, due to... logistic issues, safety issues....

Imagine this: a building collapses and there are 67 people inside.

How many arrangements do you think they would approve to save the lives of those innocent people? Inspector, let's be clear.

You only have two choices. One: to punish us. Two: to save lives.

And I'm afraid you can't choose both things.

"You have a new message.

Mum, I've just finished. I'm on my way.

To call back, press 1."

I'm going to promise you one thing.

If you refuse to punish us, I'll give you those 67 hostages in perfect health, when we are in international waters.

And I assure that's not the first choice I had.

I hate the sea, the fish and the sand on the beach.

"But life don't always give you an easy way out, don't you think?"

"I got a message from my daughter this morning, from that phone.

I don't... I'm Raquel Murillo's mother. And I can't locate her.

Please, do you know where she is? It's urgent."

We're bringing that lorry to get them out of that mouse trap.

It'll be easier for us in the open field.

Let's get the vehicles ready with narcotic gas.

-They're not coming out. -How do you know?

They opened that vault, but they didn't want the money.

They waited for the police.

They shot.

"They dropped two bags, coincidentally open, dispersing the notes in the street."

-So? -They wanted to pretend they were trapped to win two days of negotiation.

But they're inside on purpose.

With a Browning machine gun, red overalls, masks and everything.

They triggered the alarm two hours after they had come in.

"Once they had opened the safe vault."

They used the money as the excuse for a common robbery, but it wasn't casual.

They came in when the ambassador's daughter was there.

"That's why that man speaks without hesitation.

He's in control, because he knows everything goes according to plan.

What plan is better than going out with the eight millions of the safe vault?

They're printing their own unmarked money.

-It's here, right? -Yes, wait.

Be careful.

-Why isn't it working? -The finger isn't clean.

Has it got delayed opening, like the other one?

No.

-Okay. -Come on.

-You can't come in. -I've got a phone call for inspector Murillo, Raquel Murillo.

-Fine. -It's urgent and private.

-It's urgent. -Go ahead.

-Thanks. -Stretch your arms.

Come with me.

-An incoming call in the repeater. -Record it. Now.

It's recording.

"A civilian is going towards the command post, he's with Almansa.

He wants to see the inspector, a private and urgent matter."

Excuse me, inspector, but I've got your mother on the phone.

I guess you phoned her from my phone. Excuse me.

I think it has to do with your daughter.

-Hello? -"Darling."

-Mum, what's up? -Stop recording.

-"Paula has left with her father." -What?

-"He told me it'd only be a while." -Mum, what did you do?

-"They haven't come back yet." -Alberto has got a restraining order.

He can only see Paula every 15 days and he can't get in the house.

-"I know, darling." -Stop recording, jeez!

-We can't. -Then turn down the volume!

"I couldn't..."

Mum, mum.

-How long ago did they leave? -"Two hours, I think."

Okay, wait for me there.

-What a mess have you got here, huh? -Almansa, take him out, please.

The shots you heard were caused by a situation with the police.

It was caused by a hostage who didn't follow my rules and tried to contact... using this phone.

And I wonder...

If I have Miss Gaztambide's phone...

Whose is this one?

Is this tune familiar to any of you?

What has happened?

What are you doing?

We've all heard the shots.

I've asked you what the hell has happened.

Not here.

We said no victims.

She had a phone. What should I have done, give her some lashes?

Scare her, not kill her. Cut her an ear, like in the movies.

If she had given information to the police about how many and where we are, now you'd be the one having been shot.

But you'd keep your ear.

Who shot?

Denver.

Too much hot blood.

The Professor said we wouldn't spill blood, -those were the rules. -Well, there has just been a change concerning hostage control.

Understood?

Calm down, the public opinion is on our side and that's not going to change.

When they notice there's a hostage missing, we won't be here.

We'll be far away.

Does the Professor know that? Huh?

Does the Professor know you've broken the first fucking rule of the plan?

Are you telling me about the rules?

You, who due to your affair with this jerk almost killed an officer?

We must call the Professor and tell him.

Boy.

Call him, Rio.

He doesn't answer.

You can't look out and control everything 24 hours a day.

You must eat, sleep, go to the toilet.

That's why I'm in charge here.

We'll only get out of here if we're professional.

Can you tell me what the heck is going on here?

I could hear you from the outside.

Berlin has ordered the execution of a hostage.

Who did it?

Your son.

"A thief is, by definition, an inveterate optimist.

They always think everything will be all right, but the first who realised was Moscow.

He was one of those men who are honest, who give confidence, take care of you and tell bad jokes.

I felt tenderness towards him."

What are you listening to?

Great music.

Do you know how music was invented?

-No. -On a train.

There was a father and his son, whose name was Patxi.

The boy was very worried to know if the train would stop at their village or not. Besides, the child was a real pest.

And he kept on saying: "Will it stop, dad?"

And his father: "It will, Patxi." "Will it stop, dad?" "It will, Patxi."

And what about Denver and you? Relatives and artistic duo in robberies?

Yes, just like the Sacapuntas Duo, but with burglaries.

"That afternoon Moscow told me how he had dragged his son to that crazy robbery."

My son shouldn't be here. But when the Professor told me about the plan, I dragged him with me.

Hey!

There.

Give me a hug, jeez.

You really like the food in prison, right?

-Don't touch me, they're gases. -Gases, sure.

And the saturated fats they give us to eat there.

-Right. -Give me a cigarette, come on.

I've got it ready. Here.

How are you? How's your life?

Fine. Here I am.

-What's the matter? -What do you mean?

-I'm excited to see you, dad. -Don't try to fool me.

It's the sixth time you come to pick me up and you've never looked that way.

What the fuck is up?

I've fucked it up.

What the hell did you do?

He had lost 800 pills.

Of someone called Pole, a shitty dealer from Alcorcأ³n.

It seems they had been stolen from his car.

And he's got a boss.

That motherfucker is a lunatic.

And they break your nasal septum, they break you a leg...

So everybody knows you stole the drugs to the wrong man.

Dad, the deadline is finishing and I haven't got the dough.

I swear to God I haven't got it, they stole it from my car, I didn't sell it or anything. I didn't take those pills, drugs make me ill.

So, not to have his meniscus broken by a baseball bat, you said:

"Let's make him print notes."

He's already done all the bad works: fur shops, savings banks, vans...

And now... turn for a big one.

If everything goes well, I'm taking my son to a country whose name we can't even pronounce.

Without Poles, without pending cases, to start from scratch.

But of course, with mojitos and beaches.

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

-Boy, don't you see I'm washing the floor? -I left my notes to study.

-You left your notes... Come on, beat it. -Don't be a pest, let me do it.

-Will you...? -Dad, I have to study, -I left my notes. I'm coming. -Beat it, come on. Come on.

Come on, go away. Jeez.

Moscow!

Stop.

For the last time, go back to your position.

What are you going to do?

Shoot me?

And then who?

Everyone?

Are you staying alone in this mouse trap?

Son.

Have you killed that woman?

Dad.

Nothing.

-I can't breathe. -Dad.

Dad, what's up? What's up?

Dad, is it a heart attack?

Are you having a heart attack? Dad, no, no.

It's an anxiety attack. Lie him down. Lie him down.

-Dad, dad. -That's it.

"Lying on that floor full of blood, Moscow knew there'd be no caipirinhas or any country they couldn't pronounce.

He hadn't taken Denver there to save him from something, but to sink him in a hole from which he'd only get out arrested or with a bullet in his chest."

Excuse me. Sorry.

The shot we've heard before... Is anyone hurt?

Calm down, all right?

Nobody was hurt. Okay?

We only shot to dissuade an intervention. Just that.

You've heard that. Stop thinking weird things about those shots, okay? These people are robbers, not from the jihad or anything similar.

-Mum. -Honey, I'm sorry.

It's a rollercoaster.

Well, which is the other one, where you get wet?

-The spinning boats. -Oh, yes, the boats.

Your mother.

Mummy! We've been at the amusement park. It's so cool.

Of course, honey.

Mum, can you go upstairs and leave the teddy bear in her room?

Sure, honey.

Come here, love.

You've violated a restraining order.

Turn around and stand against the wall.

Raquel, I'm her father. You can't keep me away from Paula.

You've violated a restraining order. Turn around and stand against the wall.

You've already screwed up my life. Isn't that enough?

-I said stand...! -What are you doing?

Really?

Are you pointing at me with your gun?

Hello?

"Raquel, it's Salva. I'm calling you from the cafeteria.

Look, this is urgent, you took away my phone.

Raquel?"

Dad. Dad.

How are you feeling?

I'm cold.

-Cold? -Yes.

-Bring a blanket. -Yes.

-And some sugar, whatever. -Come on, Helsinki, go get some sugar.

You're like a built-in wardrobe.

Don't know what happened to me.

It's because I spent the whole morning... digging the tunnel.

And I only ate one of those shitty sandwiches.

Now rest, dad. Rest.

You know what would do you good now?

A good stew, one of those you like.

-With chickpeas and pork. -Here. The blanket, come on.

-Fine. Relax, Moscow. -Thanks.

Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

Now relax, all right?

What are you doing here, dad? God!

I wake up at 4:00 A.M. and you're not in bed.

Nothing, jeez, I couldn't sleep and I went out to look at the sky.

The sky...

The sky is huge, right?

Where must all that end?

-What's up? -Nothing.

-Do you know why I left the mine? -Of course I do.

Due to that shit that was eating your lungs.

-The "syphilis." -The "syphilis", right?

-What's up? -You're fucking brute.

-Silicosis. -That's what I said.

But it wasn't that.

I left it because I suffered from claustrophobia.

-You? -Yes.

I couldn't stand being in that hole.

So I started with robberies to make a living.

And I ended up in prison. Locked up, like my whole fucking life.

Are you okay, dad? You sound strange.

Not strange.

I'm fucking great, here, in the countryside, in the open air.

I wasn't born to be over a barrel.

-We're fucking great, dad. -Yes.

And it'd be greater when we leave this place.

You know one thing?

Fuck the Maserati and they gyms.

You know what we're going to do with our millions?

We're going to buy an island.

So you can sleep in the raw among the palm trees.

In a hut. One hut for you, another for me.

-Yes. -No sleeping together like here, -because you snore too much. -What are you saying? I don't snore, kid.

Dad, you snore like crazy, believe me.

-Do I snore? -You snore a lot.

-I don't snore. -You sound like a trombone, dad.

Put it in.

One second, okay?

There.

Let him rest.

Finish cleaning the toilet.

And then swap your position with Helsinki and watch the hostages.

Hello.

I'm sorry. I'm a mess.

No, really, don't worry. I don't think I have any calls.

Let me see. Look, not even a single WhatsApp. See?

I don't...

Excuse me, it's not my business at all, but... is everything all right with your daughter?

I stole your phone, I frisked you, I almost arrested you, but you're still worried about me?

Well, you took the phone accidentally.

It was due to the nerves.

And the frisk was... Well, it was funny.

What can I say? It was exciting.

"The recorder. Where's the recorder?"

-My arm was here... -I'm sorry.

-I'm sorry. -Antonio was petrified.

Anyway, then he invited me. So we're at peace now.

-Everything's fine, thank you. -Fine.

-Fine. -Good. I'm glad.

In the end, we worry a lot about many things and we shouldn't give so much importance to things. In the end...

Well, actually... nothing's fine.

Everything... is quite bad.

Awful.

Fucking awful, I'd say.

God...

Excuse me, but... I...

No, the emergency was... my ex-husband had taken my daughter and...

Well, he's got a restraining order for ill-treatment.

Thanks.

Thanks.

I brought you some things to treat you.

-Does it hurt a lot? -A bit.

Let's apply the tourniquet better, okay?

-Okay. -Let's see.

Let's see.

I think we should take out...

-Yes. -Okay.

Shall I help you?

Slowly.

Come on, almost there.

Okay, okay.

Jeez!

Okay, okay.

Careful, careful.

Okay, that's it.

Oh, my God.

Wait.

I think we should take the bullet out.

No, no. No, there are muscles, bones and such.

-You'll make a mess. -I'll do it carefully.

-How are you taking it out? -I take it out and...

-You can't take it out with that. -It's better out than inside.

No. Some people have bullets and they're okay.

I've seen it on TV. And pieces of glass... It's all right.

-Okay, okay. -Leave it there.

We'll cover the bleeding and see how you progress, okay?

-Yes. -Calm down.

Okay.

Okay, okay.

Okay, okay.

Okay.

Fine.

Just like when we were kids and played that Operation game...

Okay.

I brought loads of antibiotics.

Painkillers, muscle relaxants... Everything.

Won't that be bad?

I hope it doesn't have contraindications.

Well, it can't have more contraindications than a bullet.

I was thinking of the baby.

You're right.

Okay, okay.

I'll read the pamphlet and see what we do, okay?

Let me see.

"Read this pamphlet carefully before you start taking the medicine.

Keep this pamphlet, because you might need to read it again.

If you have doubts, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

This medicine has been prescribed and...

Okay.

No.

Hey. Have you got more noodles?

Not noodles. I have some rice.

It's all right.

Moscow.

Moscow, what are you doing? Hey!

What the fuck are you doing?

Tokyo, what's up?

-I don't know. -Don't open the doors!

Moscow!

-They're opening the doors. -Get ready.

-Come on, come on! -In your places.

Don't move!

Snipers.

-"Alpha 1 positioned. -Alpha 2 positioned.

Alpha 3 positioned."

On the floor! Everyone!

On the floor! Now!

I have a shot.

-In three, two, one. -Dad!

-Cover your face! Cover your face! -Let me out.

-They're not wearing masks. -"They're wrestling."

-No, dad. -I have to get out.

-Record it. -"I can't see their faces."

-I have to get out. -Out? Why?

"Sir, I have a shot."

It's my fault. You shouldn't be here. You shouldn't have killed anyone.

-"Waiting for the order. -Have I got the green light, sir?"

-Let me out. -You want to turn yourself in

-so you can be the patsy. -"We don't know if they're robbers.

Have I got the green light, sir?"

-Let me out. -I didn't kill her.

-Let me out. -I didn't kill her.

She's hidden.

"The doors are closing, sir. Three seconds.

-Doors closed. -Don't shoot."

Jesus!

-Let me out. -We're getting out, dad.

Outside, so you can breathe fresh air.

-I need some air. -Yes.

I'm so sorry that you had gone through...

Through an experience so...

Well, if you need some kind of help, I can give you...

A phone always at your disposal, a bodyguard with glasses...

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have joked about something like that.

-I'm a jerk. -No, don't worry.

I apologise. But I see you and... And it doesn't fit.

It's not what I imagine when I think about...

About what? A battered woman?

Because I've got a gun, right?

Listen, the reality is that... it doesn't start with a smack.

In that case, nobody would be with a violent man.

It's the other way round.

You're...

You fall in love with a charming and intelligent man... who makes you feel the centre of the universe.

And when he asks you to change your profile picture and use a picture of your daughter, you think it's tender.

And when he tells you not to wear a miniskirt to work, you think: "I'm a woman who works in a men's world, he's actually protecting me."

And then one day... he raises his voice...

-You don't have to tell me. -Yes, yes. I need it.

Look, it's like...

It's like going down steps little by little.

Like in those horror films where somebody goes down to the basement and everybody thinks: "Don't go downstairs. Don't do it."

But you do it.

That's where I got the first slap.

And then the second, and the third...

And finally I got the divorce.

Didn't you report him?

No. He was a police officer, the most popular guy in the station, and I just wanted to lose sight of him.

I guess... I was ashamed to sit down in front of my boss and tell him about a year and a half of humiliation and blows.

I've got a 9mm HK in my holster, but... I really don't fucking know how to take care of myself.

Don't say that.

But... the real drama came some months later.

Because my sister fell in love with him.

They started going out, and travelling.

And then I reported him, late and without evidence.

Because I didn't want my sister to get into that hell.

Do you understand?

But, sure, I only seemed to be a pathological jealous woman making a fake complaint.

"See? The inspector didn't report him back then but she does now he's with her sister."

But, Raquel, the police or the judges must believe you, it's impossible not to believe you.

Raquel, now I've felt the emotion and the helplessness.

There must be someone who can help you.

-Someone. Who's going to help me? -Me.

Sorry, I don't know how I could help you, but...

Thanks.

Raquel.

-Raquel. -أپngel.

There's movement in the building.

They opened the door for a few seconds and there was a brawl.

-We think it was with a hostage. -Let's go.

Listen, I want you to know this is not a threat, but a personal favour I'm asking you, not as a robber.

I want you to put on the masks, the hoods and to get out to the terraced roof without any signals or silly things.

Only for 10 minutes, okay?

You go out, have some fresh air and come back, all right?

What do you want, to distract the police?

The police is already distracted, so leave them alone and don't ruffle any feathers.

We're bait. They're using us as bait.

-What's that? -They're throwing us to the wolves and meanwhile they'll escape using another door.

We're getting out due to humanity, because one of our mates needs to breathe, and I won't tell you again.

Don't move.

What fucking world are we living in?

Nobody's willing to do anything for anybody, right?

One of us has an anxiety attack and you only think that you're a bait.

Nothing's gonna happen.

Nothing's gonna happen, because I'm going out with you.

Why did he have an anxiety attack?

Due to shots. It was the shots, right?

It was the shots. Who did you kill? Who did you kill?

Open your mouth, Arturo.

Open your fucking mouth, Arturo.

Open your mouth.

Now raise your left hand if you're going to keep on fucking around.

If you're going to keep your mouth shut, raise your right hand.

Fine.

Denver, stop it, now.

Stop it.

Stop goofing around, please.

-He wasn't a hostage. -Why do you say that?

Because, unless they're Gandhi's disciples, they'd never let a hostage get so far without shooting him in the back. One of them wanted to turn himself in.

Now, dad.

Breathe some air.

You don't need to do this for me.

I remember when mum left, you had trouble breathing, you went out to the balcony to try to do it every night.

So, it doesn't matter, you're going out there, breathe some fresh air and when you're calm, we'll get back.

Everyone with the masks and the hoods on. Arturito, close to me.

Here Condor 3 calling the command centre. Movement on the roof.

Suأ،rez, the snipers must be ready.

-"It's a big group." -Everyone in position.

"Maximum attention, we have visuals. They're moving."

-Dad, calm down. -Okay.

Look, it's a fucking great day.

-Yes. -It's very sunny, huh?

Breathe and relax.

"It's a big group. They keep on walking on the roof.

They're moving towards the edge of the roof."

-Hello? -"What's going on?"

-Why are they on the roof? -Moscow went out to have some fresh air surrounded by hostages with fake guns.

As you know well, I'd never have allowed this crazy thing, but right now my mates are convincing me

-it's a good idea. -"I don't want any further improvisation."

Keep me posted of everything.

"They keep on walking. They're getting to the edge."

If you don't start having a cool head, forget about the millions, Acapulco and the garden full of children, because you'll screw all up.

You only have to do one thing: be professionals.

Doesn't this seem professional to you?

-Precious. -No, not precious.

A fucking note better than the ones in the bank.

They can't even trace it. A work of art.

-And you know why? -Enlighten me, Nairobi.

Because it's been made with care.

I'm a professional.

But I don't know what to do when your father has the heebie-jeebies in the middle of this mess.

Are you a robber before a son?

Huh, Berlin?

Before a human being?

For a shithead like you maybe yes, but... I don't know.

-Didn't you kill that girl? -No.

-Tell me the fucking truth. -I didn't!

Berlin caught her with a phone, ordered me to kill her and I had to shoot her, -I had no choice. -You're talking about Mأ³nica.

You're talking about Mأ³nica.

-What are you doing? -What did you do to Mأ³nica?

Go back to your place.

This is not a courtesy call, Professor.

If you want me to be frank and not hide information from you, you should do the same.

Everybody has the right to stretch their legs.

"Don't you think it's solidary of me to let the hostages go out to breathe?"

I assure it's not my intention torturing or scaring them.

"I only want to return them safe and sound" as soon as you give me what I requested.

That's all.

"I repeat, they're armed, take cover in the operation.

I request instructions."

-What did you do? -Go back to your place.

-Tell me where Mأ³nica is. -Go back.

-"Something happens. -I request instructions."

You killed Mأ³nica, Jesus. She was innocent.

-Here Condor 1. Visual of the targets. -"I request the green light."

-On your knees. -What?

-She was pregnant. -Fucking snipers.

Let them think we're hostages. Your hands on your head.

Don't play with me, stand up. I'm talking to you.

-"Something happens. -They're bending down."

-They made them kneel to execute them. -"I need a command."

There are snipers.

On your knees, there are snipers.

Everybody down.

Go back to your place.

-"A lot of movement on the roof. -Condor 3 here."

One Dalأ­ is aiming with his gun at another.

-"I can see it clearly. -I request instructions, sir."

-I need authorization. -"They're still on their knees, sir.

-I'm waiting for instructions." -Give me the green light.

-They're running. -I have a shot at the kidnapper.

-What the fuck are you doing? -There are snipers, jeez.

-On your knees. -"They're aiming."

-Give me the green light. -"They're going to execute them.

-They're going to shoot. -I request to open fire."

Put down the gun!

"They're going to kill them."

Green light.

Condor 3, open fire.

-"Target's down, sir. -Target's down.

Target's down.

We have visual."

He's the manager of the factory, Arturo Romأ،n.

-Stop the fire. -Condor 3, stop the fire.

All units, stop the fire.

We've shot a hostage.

-"I'm waiting for instructions. -I have a shot at the kidnapper."

-What the fuck are you doing? -There are fucking snipers.

-On your knees. -"They're aiming."

-Give me the green light. -"They're going to execute them.

-They're going to shoot. -I request to open fire."

Put down the gun!

"They're going to kill them."

Green light.

-Condor 3, open fire. -Behind you.

SATURDAY 06:00 PM

Good! Good, Mr Torres. Good. Very good.

But now let's change the series, okay?

Let's change the letter, all right?

Another country, yes. Don't complain. Come on.

Helsinki! Come down, hurry up.

-What have we got? -He's seriously injured. Hurry up!

You killed her, motherfuckers.

Hurry up.

Water, water, please.

Water, please. Water.

Thanks. Arturo, hold on tight. Rio, Rio!

Alcohol, alcohol.

I need you to take your hand off...

-Raquel.

"Ex-employees of the paper money factory have revealed the identity of the man hurt by the police.

It's Arturo Romأ،n, the general manager of the factory, who has just been hurt by the police forces, while he was on the roof with the robbers.

The events took place after 32 hours since the beginning of the kidnapping."

32 HOURS OF ROBBERY I need to talk to my wife, please.

I need to talk to my wife.

"They say that when we're at Deathâ€™s door we're finally able to see our life with clarity.

And Arturo Romأ،n, losing blood on a table, was waiting for that: Death's clairvoyance.

To find out once and for all who the love of his life had been.

Laura, the woman with whom he had shared 14 years of holy matrimony?

Or Mأ³nica, his secretary and lover, with whom he had felt young again?

Unfortunately, the only certainty Arturo had at that moment was that, if they didn't take out the bullet, he'd kick the bucket before solving the enigma.

And, frankly, our first aid courses weren't a guarantee for living."

Inferior cava.

Right renal.

Left.

Mesenteric.

Right pulmonary.

Left.

This is the heart.

Cava.

Subclavian, right and left.

Brachial.

Humeral.

Internal jugular.

External jugular.

And in red the main arteries.

Hey, stop, stop.

Let's see.

Do you want us to learn medicine this way, with two markers?

If anyone is shot, he can't go to a hospital.

You have to manage inside.

-It'll be fucking suicide. -Shut the fuck up.

One thing is to lock ourselves up in that mouse trap.

-Another thing would be that we die. -Denver.

We're asking you to learn how to take out a bullet.

Don't start with "the epic tales about the outskirts".

It's not that hard.

You get the pliers, take out the bullet without screwing it up.

-That's all. -The shot already screwed it up.

If they shoot me, take me to the hospital.

The answer is "no."

Well, I prefer being lame and free rather than with excellent health but in a cell.

Nobody will go out.

Anyone of you is a clue and a thread that can be pulled.

If somebody wants to resign, this is the moment.

He will stay here during the robbery and then he'll leave.

Will the lesson last long?

My willy is shrinking like Helsinki's.

Hey! What did you say about my willy?

-Enough. Enough. -Do you want to see my willy?

Please.

Come on, get dressed. Let another one lie here, please.

-Mr Willy. -Come on.

Come on.

-No? No, no... -Well, there we go.

-Well... -Come on, Nairobi.

-It's all right, isnâ€™t it? -Come on, Nairobi!

So sexy!

-She's black. -Sexy, sexy.

-Go on. -Wow! Okay.

Let's see what you learnt.

This is the carotid...

"And so, playing doctors, I found out Nairobi was more interesting than she seemed."

The heart.

The aorta...

"And, although nobody knew anything about anyone,..."

The abdominal aorta.

"...what I never had suspected was that Nairobi had a son.

Or a daughter.

As it seemed by her C-section scar."

-What are you doing? What are you doing? -Hey, hey!

-Where are you going? -What's up?

What are you looking at?

-What's up? -Calm down.

No. You're going to eat that marker.

-What's up? -She's a bit of a lesbian.

Don't know what the fuck sheâ€™s looking at.

You're the lesbian. Your nugget was as hard as a sugar cube.

As a sugar cube? I'm going to...

Stop it!

"And that's where our friendship started."

Raquel, the Ministry on the phone.

What shall I tell them? Raquel? What shall I say?

-Raquel! What shall I say? -Pardon?

-They'll ask who gave the order. -I gave the order.

Tell them... the wounded man is a hostage.

-And hang up the fucking phone! -He looked like a robber.

I asked for the green light. I insisted.

Inspector, I assume responsibility with you.

Inspector, the ambulance is ready.

Let's talk to the kidnapper.

"Preparing the communication with the kidnapper."

We had to make a decision. They were...

It seemed they'd execute them, we had to decide, there was no time.

Silence, please!

Professor?

"You fired upon the hostages.

One is between life and death. I guess that's why youâ€™re calling."

I've got the ambulance to evacuate the injured man.

Nobody's getting out of here.

-That man is bleeding out. -"Due to the bullet you shot."

Will you let him die?

"Let me get a medical team there."

Professor, listen.

I know it was my mistake, "but if a hostage dies, it'll be as awful for you as for me.

Believe me, in less" than five minutes public opinion will know that that man died because you didn't let us come in and save his life.

"Two surgeons and a nurse with surgical equipment.

-Let me know when they arrive." -Thanks.

"I also have something to ask you."

The injured man wants to talk to his wife.

Of course.

Jesus.

Locate Mr Romأ،n's wife.

When can the medical team be here?

By helicopter from La Paz, 10 or 15 minutes.

-Bring them here. Now! -Okay.

Places everyone, come on.

Please, places everyone.

Excuse me.

Can you drive?

Yes, yes.

I need to get out of here, go for a drive.

-Yes. -Thanks.

Hey, Raquel.

What's up?

I have to think.

Drive.

Don't look at me like that. I'm not leaving you alone.

Where the fuck is she?

That bitch has escaped!

Let's see...

I'm coming.

There we go.

Tell me, my child.

"Will you be able to come here tonight?"

-I don't know, mum. -"But why? What's the matter?"

Mum, it's...

I'm...

I made

"a very big mistake at work."

My child, your work is very difficult.

"Come on, tell me, there's nothing" that still seems so serious five minutes after being told.

I was drinking wine with...

"I like that. With who?"

Do I know him?

No, mum. I don't know him either.

The thing is... When I came back to the tent, there was a very serious situation, "a risky one, on the roof of the factory and...

I thought one of the hostages was in danger," so I gave... the order to open fire.

And an innocent man was shot.

-Yes. I've seen it on TV, my child. -"Now I don't know what to do."

I don't know whether to phone his wife, give a press conference, resign... I don't know what to do, mum.

Well, first of all, relax and don't blame yourself.

"They're there with masks and guns," locked up, all jumbled up.

You only wanted to protect the hostages, right?

"Honey... What if you had saved somebody's life?"

What? You wouldn't be phoning me, right?

"Well..., and now I..." wouldn't know that you meet strangers

"and have a drink with them."

God! I... I don't meet strangers.

My child, we have so little time in this life...

Okay, mum, but that's not the question now.

The question is I'm in a critical situation at work.

Honey, send that work to hell.

"Why don't you tell them you want to stamp passports?

This way you may have some fun. Heavens!"

"Or do you think in the future you'll be holding hands with the kidnapper" in an old people's home? You won't, my child.

But maybe with that stranger...

"Don't laugh, I know what I'm talking about. Iâ€™ve been..." a widow for 20 years and...

Time doesn't stop, my child.

And it doesn't go back either, you know?

-Getting in the perimeter. -I'll think about it, mum.

If you see it's late, go to bed, all right?

Fine.

Listen and you go to bed

"with someone too."

RACHEL LIKES A STRANGER

-What the fuck do you want? -I don't know. I saw that earlier and...

And it drew my attention.

I didn't know what it was.

-Sorry. -Okay, I forgive you.

Okay, see you later.

What are you doing?

Beat it, will you? I don't want any chitchat.

How old is he?

Your son.

Seven.

He's seven.

Where's he?

With his father?

With his father? Not with him. He's never been with his father.

We don't know anything about his father.

What's his name?

Axel.

His name's Axel.

It means "axe."

-Axe. -Yes.

-And he's an ace. -Right...

Just like his mother.

That child is a survivor, you know?

He has survived everything.

He's like a cork in the middle of the sea, he doesn't sink.

That's the way he is.

When he was three...

I had to take him away from my mother's house because her husband... gave him anisette when I wasn't there, because his sobs bothered him.

So I took him away.

Only the two of us, not needing a family.

Me and him.

And we were fucking great.

But I screwed it up.

One day...

I had to go to get pills to sell.

And...

And I left him alone.

For five minutes.

I'd be away five minutes, right?

And he made a mess with the fucking Spider-Man.

I piss on Spider-Man!

Because he wanted to be a superhero.

He climbed everywhere. He climbed very well.

And he got to the terrace through the window.

There he took a chair, went on the chair and shouted: "Mummy!"

"Mummy!"

He was three and a half.

Sure, five minutes later we had a police patrol, the firemen...

Everybody.

They caught me with the pills, with a record, without a job.

And to prison I went.

So my child started moving from one foster family to the next, from hand to hand.

And I got nothing.

Nothing, huh?

I wasn't allowed a single visit, a single call...

Nothing.

Then I was released from prison... and nothing happened.

They didn't give him back to me.

-Have you seen him again? -They won't let me.

But...

I know where he is.

-Really? -He's in the Canary islands.

He's with a family who owns a hotel.

He's fine.

Are you going to go and get him?

I'm taking him... and that's final.

To the other side of the world.

I'm telling you one thing.

In this robbery nobody's going to screw it up, me or anyone, if somebody makes a mess of it, I'll destroy his life.

Of all the plans all these people have, yours... is the best.

And I'm telling you another thing...

Do you like tequila?

It's 4:03 am.

There's a lesson early in the morning.

Plastic explosive.

Sorry.

It'd be great if you were rested for the class.

-We couldn't sleep. -Go to bed.

-The three of us together? -Each of us to their bed.

The pyjamas look really good on you, Professor.

Now.

Now.

And you... And you with the lights.

That guy really turns me on, he really turns me on.

-He really turns me on! -Really? I can't tell at all.

Can you notice?

-A lot. -Let him notice.

What a racket, man!

Jesus...

Mأ³nica. Hey... Hey.

-What are you doing here? Are you crazy? -I wasn't feeling very well.

I think it's the medicine, it got me sick.

The medicine.

That will be it, the medicine. Yes, child. That'll be it.

Oh my, you're boiling like a kettle.

She must get the hell out of here.

-I'll help you. -Wait, wait.

Could you leave me alone

-for a while? -Yes.

Please.

What do you think?

She's not feeling very well. She looks bad.

If we don't take that bullet out bullet, she's fucked.

Dad, calm down, all right?

She'll be fine.

Why did you fucking shoot her?

Because Berlin was going to kill her. I had no other choice.

Son of a bitch.

If he wants to kill somebody, he should pull the trigger, not you.

We came for a robbery.

Not to kill people. Or to save lives.

We're fucking wretches, jeez.

-Of all the people... -Dad, calm down.

Calm down.

Mأ³nica, have you finished yet?

Yes.

-Let's go. -Raquel, wait a second.

I want to talk to you.

I want to infiltrate the medical team.

No. Somebody's getting in, but not you.

Sure. There's always someone better than me for everything.

Raquel, I'm a firearms expert.

I can get there and, at a glance, know how many they have, what type and if they're fake or not.

We can know who the robbers are.

You're right.

You'll come with me and cover the doctors.

Now I'll tell you what weâ€™re doing.

I heard a shot before.

The police. They shot a hostage.

-A hostage? -Yes.

Who?

Who?

Who did the police shoot?

The manager of the factory.

Arturo?

Did the police kill Arturo?

No. They didn't kill him.

-Is he okay? -Yes.

Is he alive?

-Is Arturo okay? -He's fine. Yes.

-Are you sure? -Sure.

-Is he okay? -A surgeon is coming in.

With his team.

He'll have surgery and will be saved.

-Is he having surgery? -Yes.

You must tell him I'm alive.

You must tell Arturo.

-Do you hear me? -Nobody is telling anything.

Because you'll be fine and he will as well, okay?

Come on. Let's have a look at the wound.

Calm down.

He is going to blame himself. I took the phone because he told me to.

And that now I'm dead because of him.

You must tell him I'm alive, okay?

And his son too.

Are you pregnant?

Very well.

Congratulations.

-Give me a pen, please. -Okay.

When?

Thanks.

أپngel!

I've decided to get our officers inside the building.

I'll do it by taking advantage of the medical intervention.

I celebrate these decisions you make during ambulance rides.

But my presence here responds only to the government's wish that there isn't a violent outcome.

Wow!

The CNI officer has suddenly become a pacifist.

Weren't you the one who wanted to get the tanks in there?

I wanted to catch them by surprise. Finish with this soon.

But now the priority is zero victims.

So I advise to negotiate and wait.

It must suck a lot being here all day believing you're the best, not having to make any decisions, right?

Like being in a hostage crisis talk show.

Inspector, I'm not going to bite because I understand at a certain age hormones take over inside.

-I know it because of my mother. -Where are you going?

As you'll understand, I have to inform about all this.

Of course.

So far the kidnappers have always been ahead of us.

Everything was planned. Except this shot.

It's the first thing not according to plan.

And we must take advantage.

The only way to get in without being detected by their cameras is to advance along this tube in the subsoil that leads straight to the basements.

It's the ventilation nozzle.

It was added seven months ago to release the heat from the presses.

It's a work in progress.

-They probably won't know itâ€™s there. -I need two of your men to get in there.

Officer Garcأ­a Lobo, here, and I'll go with him.

Fine. Deputy Inspector Rubio

"will go with the two surgeons and will get in as a nurse."

06:09 pm. Synchronize watches.

"At 06:15 pm the medical team will come in.

According to the head of internal medicine the surgery won't take more than 30 minutes."

But they can go on exactly until 7:00 pm.

When the doctors go out, there'll be a big number of kidnappers to watch them.

That's when Suأ،rez and Lobo will get in through the subsoil.

"They'll get to the basementâ€™s catch basin dressed with red overalls and Dalأ­ masks."

They'll infiltrate among the hostages.

We'll only be successful if we do it like clockwork.

Inspector!

-Arturo Romأ،n's wife is here. -One moment, please.

Suأ،rez, get moving.

Take care of the doctors. And be careful.

Get the operation ready!

What happened? Is my husband okay?

Your husband is conscious and stable.

He was shot by mistake.

-Shot? What do you mean? -He's injured, but alive.

Calm down. Calm down.

The kidnappers allow us to get in a surgical team and he'll have surgery immediately.

Sorry, but... I wasn't even listening, sorry.

Calm down.

Everything's gonna be all right.

-Sit down, please. -Thanks.

-Can you talk to him right now? -Yes.

Take this.

Almansa, record it!

We must take that bullet out right now.

You do it, dad.

You're more cold-blooded.

Where's the surgical kit the Professor gave us?

-There's a scalpel there. -Berlin's got it.

Jesus.

I don't think itâ€™s a good idea to ask him for it.

The surgeons! Go and steal their tools. Hurry.

-Okay. -Wait! Wait!

Give him the note, please.

I'll clean the wound now, okay?

Relax. You're going to be fine.

-"Hello?" -Professor, Arturo Romأ،n's wife is here.

Okay.

Arturo.

Arturo!

What's your wifeâ€™s name?

Laura.

What a beautiful name. Well, you can talk to Laura.

Wives are good for moments like these.

They're comforting.

Nobody remembers his wife when you're in front of the disco, high as a kite, but...

If you have a problem, an accident or... you're simply scared,... things change.

Are you thinking about your secretary right now?

Huh? Yes?

No.

But who can think about lovers with babies who could be aborted...

-or simply nothing? -Spare me the speech, will you?

Listen to me.

If you say something weird, I'll give you the coup de grace and your wife will hear it live. Understand?

Inspector!

They're turning on a phone.

We must tap that phone.

I want to see the selfie and main cameras.

There, there.

"Hello, darling."

Arturo, darling, how are you?

Fine, fine. I'm fine.

-"It was a clean shot." -There's no image.

No selfie or main cameras. They've covered them.

"They're letting some surgeons in."

I know.

Look, I've...

I've been thinking about you and...

And everything we did wrong.

Don't think about it, darling. Not now.

"Not now."

Besides, it's my fault.

I know we're not fine. We haven't been fine for some time.

I've neglected you and our children. I've been selfish.

I promise all that's going to change, you hear me?

"I promise that's going to change.

For 10 years you've been saying you want to see your sister in Australia."

Take the opportunity so the kids can learn English.

And see kangaroos.

"That's the first thing we'll do when we go out."

I owe you that.

I'll do it for you.

Because I love you so much.

All these years wasted, chasing...

Thinking all that mattered was money and the status and...

"But you're the only important thing.

It's always been you."

Since the day I met you.

I swear there are times when...

I try to remember that day...

"And I wonder what the hell you saw in me, Mأ³nica."

Laura.

You just think about getting out of there.

"Just think about that.

I love you."

I love you, honey.

Are you okay?

Calm down.

You're really experienced, Arturo.

Your secretary... with the belly...

Laurita waiting for you in the 4x4 with the children.

You, surrounded by money, are a legend.

Berlin!

The doctors are outside!

You must excuse me.

-Do they all know what they have to do? -They do! Of course they do!

Are you ready?

Well, they're ready.

Mercedes!

Are you ready?

-Yes, sir. -I want her out of here.

Rio, take her to an office.

Nairobi.

Put on your masks!

And with me! Rock and roll!

Come in.

Leave everything on the floor.

Close the door.

Move forward.

Your hands on your head and legs apart.

We're frisking you.

Get him out of here, please.

"Listen to me."

One of the nurses is an undercover cop.

-Which one? -"The one with glasses.

You know what you have to do."

-Perfectly. Let's get to it. -Berlin!

It has to be a fucking precision work.

I know.

People!

The one with glasses is the cop.

They'll come in.

Maybe during an assault, during an emergency...

It could be the Red Cross guy or the pizza guy, but it's obvious theyâ€™ll try to infiltrate someone.

And that will be our chance to try and give them a Trojan horse.

Do you know what that is?

-I don't know, but it rhymes easily. -No!

-The Trojan horse... -Was pretty hoarse!

Shut up and focus, Jesus!

Sorry.

I'm sorry.

The Greeks were at war with the Trojans.

One day the Trojans found in front of their city a wooden horse, a huge wooden horse!

And, out of vanity, they thought it was a surrender present by the Greeks.

So they opened the gates... and they put it inside.

But they didn't know that horse was hollow and full of Greek warriors.

That night the Trojans lost the war.

And that's exactly what we are going to do.

When they try to get in thinking they're winning the battle...

Leave all your metallic objects on that tray.

Glasses.

Watches.

If you have weapons, microphones... I also advise you to let them there.

We're going to track any type of radiofrequency.

Take off your shoes too. Please.

And now lie down.

On the ground.

Very well.

Like cockroaches.

Stand up.

Put on your shoes.

Take only the glasses.

You're going to need them.

"Now yes... Welcome. Take your things and come with me.

Thanks."

-Yes? -"Inspector.

It's Suأ،rez. Weâ€™ve found something in the CCTV footage of the museum.

-It's important." -I'm on my way.

SUNDAY 8:35 AM

-Here you are. -Thanks, أپngel.

We've reviewed the hard disk of the surveillance cameras...

Listen, listen, Raquel, I'd like to apologize for last night.

I hadn't slept for 48 hours, I had a few too many glasses of wine.

-I don't want you to think... -أپngel, don't worry.

It's fine, okay?

46 HOURS OF ROBBERY Look, Suأ،rez has found a break in the case.

It's the surveillance footage of the day Anأ­bal Cortأ©s y Silene Oliveira

"visited the museum."

-Look closely at the items they put on the tray at the entrance.

Zoom in as much as you can.

There, stop. Enlarge it.

Those are car keys.

"Of a Seat, an old one, in the original key holder.

Presumably between 1989 and 1996.

We have the date and the time they entered," and the car model which they drove.

We'll canvass the area. Security cameras, car parks, shops, banks, "car park tickets from regulated parking areas, everything."

Rule out.

"The other file, scroll up.

We have to find that car at any cost.

Go through it. Good. We've got it."

It's an Ibiza from 1992.

"Great."

Those keys and that car will take us where it all began.

-Shut up. -Here are the car keys.

Nairobi and Rio get changed to go to the museum.

Me? Really?

-You. -To the city?

But, don't send me with that kid, send me with a real man, with Helsinki. Why don't you send me with Helsinki?

Yes, Helsinki prefers the hairy chest type.

Wasn't you and I who were going?

Check the CCTV cameras against the sketch from my previous visit.

We need to confirm the location, the angles and the objectives.

Come on, change your clothes.

Helsinki, a queer.

My goodness! But you like men.

War, prison...

I see, I see. Women, no.

You don't like them, do you?

-Wasn't it me who was going with Rio? -I've changed my mind.

Have you? What's happened?

Nothing, I've changed my mind and period.

What's happened?

So, you don't trust me or what?

Have I done anything? What the heck have I done?

I haven't done anything, have I?

It's not that.

No.

Did anything happened?

My mother?

A heart attack, I'm very sorry.

-When? -Yesterday.

I've decided that you won't go to the museum to avoid you from being tempted to go and say your last goodbye.

I'll stay with her. Someone else can go.

I don't need to say goodbye.

I already did it.

The last time we talked she wanted to turn me over to the police, so that woman was no longer my mother.

Professor. tell me what I have to do with Berlin.

Shall I throw him to the dogs or shall I shoot him dead?

"You're the boss."

I'll take care of that. Pass me on to Helsinki.

-It won't be the police? -Come on, here you are.

-"Helsinki." -Yes?

The photograph you gave me of the cube of scrap is of the Ibiza, isn't it?

I'm saying this because I'm looking at it closely and... it looks to me that the colour of the paint it's not exactly the same.

Me leave car in the wreck yard.

Helsinki, the photograph you gave me is it of the Ibiza?

No.

"Other car," but they said:

-"It would look like that." -I gave you 1000 euros, 1000 euros to pay them and they would turn the car into scrap before your eyes.

What did you do, did you keep the stinking 1000 euros when we were going to do a 2000 million heist?

2000 million, flying money... and 1000 euros, money in my pocket.

"Me locked up, no work, five months in Toledo...." and family...

Me send all the money to my family.

If for you 1000 euros, not important, for me very important.

Important, Helsinki. That car is a loose end and from that end they can start pulling, and find something.

We inside here leave many loose ends, "you outside there only one".

All right.

Tell me, at least, if they didn't turn the car into scrap in front of you, you wiped the fingerprints off.

Yes. Yes.

-Helsinki, what are fingerprints? -Fingerprints. Yes, Professor, yes.

-What does â€œfingerprintsâ€‌ mean? -No... I don't know.

"Did you clean the steering wheel with ammonia, the gear shaft," the windows, the dashboard, the whole bloody car?

Yes.

No. This I didn't do.

Pass me on to the kidnapper.

Sleeping does you a lot of good. You're starting really fast up this morning.

Thieves are caught by chasing them, and we're too passive.

Where is my pencil?

Let's tighten the screws on them.

"Good morning, Professor."

How is Mr. Roman after his surgery?

Well.

Resting and, the best of all, no high temperature.

"I thought you'd forgotten me, Inspector.

Quite the opposite, actually I think of you all the time.

I see, that sounds like a fantasy.

We should keep exploring that path.

If you're going to ask me, what I had for breakfast, if I had a morning orgasm

"or I like foreplay, I'll tell you it isnâ€™t about that," but yes, it's a fantasy, a fantasy with handcuffs in it.

I put them on you and I take you to the police van.

Well, it's a fantasy after all.

Surely, later on if you want, you tell me yours during a conjugal visit.

"Listen to me carefully: I'm going to break the news to you."

Firstly, the ship you were asking for, the Malaika, is at the port awaiting trial, so it still belongs to the ship owner.

That's no excuse, Inspector. The police can request authorization from the judge to use that ship in the pursuit of an act of crime

"as long as, the sentence hasn't been passed," so you can a ask for permission to use it, especially in this matter of such relevance.

Don't tell me you havenâ€™t done it.

I can see you also know about laws.

Well, just an amateur.

I enjoy reading judicial sentences.

"You'd be surprised how fascinating it can be."

All right, I'll bare it in mind now that I'll have time for it.

I will be released from the case.

"We're at a dead end."

Too many hours have passed and, as you'll understand, my superiors can't wait any longer.

If you really want to negotiate with me, release eight hostages.

Eight hostages, and they have to be underage people.

Why should I do that?

Because it's your turn to show me a gesture of goodwill.

If you want to have some credit, free those hostages.

If not, they'll assign another inspector to the case, "someone with a different approach and different objectives."

I'll give you an hour to think it over, not a minute longer.

That man doesn't want the Malaika.

Why do you say that?

Why ask for a ship that it'll take him five days to get

-if he can have any other? -To see who has a longer dick?

Inspector, I don't know why, but get them that ship and get them out of there.

He's idea is to exit from somewhere else.

-أپngel. -Tell me.

Tell the Underground Unit to canvass the sewerage system within 500 metres.

Old tunnels, drains, any whole.

-Okay. -Come on, start working!

Hey! You!

-Listen! -I finally find you!

I was trying to go to the main entrance.

Let me down!

Please, let me down! Please!

No! No! Please!

Let me down! Please!

I'm in the boot!

"Salva.

-Salva?" -Yes, hello.

Salva, it's Raquel. No nothing, I'm here at the Hanoi...

"having a drink and, well, as... I can't see you around" and it's become quite usual bumping into each other here, I thought that you may fancy a coffee

-or have a break... -"Well, I'd..." love to, but the thing is I'm not in Madrid right now.

-Salva, are you okay? -No, sorry, the thing is as I'm not focusing on my driving, a lorry almost crashed into me!

Anyway, sorry, I won't interrupt you any longer.

"No problem, I'll see you around.

And If you get back early and fancy having something to eat today...

Sorry, Salva, what...."

The thing is, yesterday I told my mother about you and... the woman is a bit hippy and eccentric, and... you see, she goes and says, out of nowhere, that perhaps I should brighten up my life a little and we should get to know each other more, nibble. Don't misunderstand me, will you?

Nibble... She meant have a bit more social life, -that's why I told you about having lunch. -Okay.

What...? What, yes? Ah, it sounds great!

-"Dinner, better?" -Perfect!

-It sounds great. -Okay, fantastic then.

-See you later, then. -Bye, ciao!

Ciao, see you later!

Please!

Let me down!

Let me down!

You don't smoke?

Fine, fine.

It won't be me the one to harm your health.

You are okay here, aren't you?

All together.

Not sensing the horror,

the shooting,

the blood, the surgery...

I must come more often.

It's difficult out there.

Last night...

I phoned a friend.

I told him how difficult it is to maintain order and harmony in here.

I told him... that I had to kill,

that I gave the order to kill... a woman.

If you don't put the dead bodies on the table, you're not respected out there.

And, you see, I...

could feel... the emotion in my friend,

his distress, his breathing, his panting

and his grief.

He...

He wasn't here, he hadn't met that woman either, Mأ³nica Gaztambide,

and for a moment...

For a moment, I though it would be great to feel what my friend feels.

Feel that... kind of emotion, that grief,

that remorse, but not...

I couldn't be moved.

How dreadful, isn't it?

I'm bothering you with my nonsense, you'll have to excuse me.

Silvia.

Silvia.

You're having an anxiety attack, aren't you?

She's only a bit nervous, but it'll go away soon.

Sure.

I'm sure it will.

Come with me.

Silvia, give me your hand.

That's good.

No... No...

"Spasiba." I came in because in the car, here and forgot something very important in the boot, very important.

Very important. Very important.

You jump the fence. Now, you tell police.

We can come to an agreement with money.

How much money?

A lot. Look.

I have a lot of money.

That's not a lot of money.

For God's sake I donâ€™t have any more. Look in my wallet.

Me count to five and let dog loose.

Do you understand?

-What are you doing? -I'm mounting the cells to put the explosives in the entry ways.

Did Berlin ask you to do it?

The Professor, a deterrent, so they can see it from the tent.

And what's that?

That bastard, had some sherry here and I'm finishing it off.

Fuck!

Boss,

the CEO position suits you very well.

Sit down, please, Ms Tokyo.

I can see you were late this morning. I'll have to report you.

I'm terribly sorry, sir.

If I...

If I show you a breast, you won't fire me?

A tempting offer, that's for sure, but you'll have to offer me something else.

I know how you feel.

-Rio... -I'm here,

inside this hole, and I start to think how I got here,

and I can't remember.

I remember one day I was asked to hack a security system, and it turned out to be of a mansion in Geneva, where nothing was left behind, not even the carpets.

I wasn't even there.

But, fuck, hacking a security system is far more fun than being the IT in a company.

So, I didn't give it a second thought. For me it was a game,

and now my parents are not there anymore.

My mother is gone, too.

But it's a little different, isnâ€™t it?

My parents are still alive.

I could have been a legal guy.

I was good at what I was doing, I could earn my living.

I could have had an ordinary life, meet an ordinary girl, have ordinary friends...

I wasn't like you.

I don't know what to tell you.

I think I need your door.

-Which door? -The door you told me about the day we went to see the museum, the day we heard your mother had died.

Cameras 12 y 13 have changed their lens.

Now they have a wider range of vision.

Camera 14 remains the same.

It points into the hall.

We can leave now.

And why should we go?

One day we can do a bit of sightseeing, kiss in bars, -on the street... -On the street?

Don't kid me. Someone may catch you.

No, not on the street.

Follow me.

I feel as if I killed her.

She was so pretty...

She's died of grief, of absence, of all the trouble I was in of my fucking crappy life....

She only wanted to protect me.

She loved me.

She loved me to bits.

And if she wanted to turn me over to the police, it was not to see me dead on the news.

When I was a little girl, I knew that, at her side, nothing wrong would happen to me.

The problem was when she wasn't there.

And your father?

There's no father.

My mother worked in a suitcase factory.

And when we couldn't make ends meet, she would work the night shift.

And as she had no one she could leave me with,

she left me alone.

I was really scared.

How old were you?

Eight, nine.

A bit younger than you now.

The thing is that my mother came up with a trick.

She draw a door

on the wall of my room.

It was a magic door.

And, if I was scared, I could open it and she would be behind it.

And when she left, did you open it?

She told me that I could open it only once.

Only once in my life,

whenever I need it,

but only once.

So when I was scared,

I used to think:

"You can still hold on a little longer.

A little longer."

I used to think that the next day I could feel more scared

and feel more alone,

and need the door.

I would have opened it the first day.

I never opened it.

You are the strongest person I know,

the most incredible one... and...

And what?

-And what? -And...

Damn!

The car park.

A parking ticket? What's this?

Yes, the regulated car park ticket from, an Ibiza of 1992.

"Two streets from here. Check the date and the time.

It's the same day the robbers went to the museum."

Good job, أپngel.

Run the registration number through the database.

I'll be the most expensive fine in history.

"It'll cost them loads of millions of euros.

Put me through the robber."

-"Inspector." -Professor, I need an answer. I want those eight hostage, the underage people.

Write down the names the ones that are coming out.

Pablo Holgado, Silvia Moreno, Abraham Salmerأ³n, Ignasi Castell, Magdalena Ribot, Rocأ­o Huertas, Jessica Sأ،nchez

-y Alicia Villanueva. -What about Alison Parker?

She's one of the girls of Brighton.

"I want her on the list."

I can see you're aware, Inspector.

"You know as well as I do that Alison is a queen of hearts

-in this house of cards. I can't do it." -It's a prerequisite that she comes out.

I'll make you a proposal:

Alison in exchange for the life of those eight people.

Sorry, what did you say?

"I'll give you Alison Parker..." and no one else.

We both know how important she is both for you and for me, "so if you want her to come out, she will come out alone."

-I have to consult it. -"You have one minute."

Phone him and tell him, that Parker is coming out.

-I'm not willing to make that decision.

It's unethical to make a choice on a hostage's life

"when you can save eight peoples' lives.

As much as you, and your ethical codes, believe the opposite," this is a matter of state.

And the first thing will be getting the ambassador's daughter out of there.

I'll take all responsibility.

Put me through the robber again.

So what?

Alison Parker.

Are you sure?

"You prefer saving Alison Parker's life to saving eight students' lives?."

-Yes, I'm sure. -I see.

Now, I have to think it over, I wasn't expecting that answer from you.

"Give me an hour to think it over."

All right. I'll expect your phone call.

If I don't phone you, you'll know anyway which decision I made.

-What did he mean by that? -I don't know, but look, the Ibiza's been deregistered for ten years.

No insurance, no owners no taxes.

-It's off the grid. -"Attention everyone. Come, please."

Come closer.

What would you do if you had to make a car disappear with no trace?

-Set it on fire. -"Well.

Search for reports of burnt cars, both municipal and from the Guardia Civil."

Sink it.

Look for any news of a car found inside any swamps, rivers or wherever.

-What else? -Dismantle it, sell it in parts.

-Burry it. -Sorry?

You dig a whole and you burry the car.

I saw it in a film and it works.

Anything else?

What's the legal way to make a car disappear and erase any trace of it?

To make a cube of scrap from it in a wreck yard.

"Priority: search in wrecking yards, scrap yards, and similar places."

Raquel, it's Sunday, theyâ€™ll be closed.

I don't care. Get the owner out of his house if necessary.

Hurry up!

Relax.

Nothing is going to happen to you.

You'll be safer here, more isolated, you won't find out about things that will make you sad.

I'm feeling better now. Can I go back with the others?

Aren't you listening to me? It's better for you to stay here.

I'll have to bind you, because you'll be alone, But you'll be better here.

I won't hurt you. Thatâ€™s it.

Let's sit down. You donâ€™t want to stand?

Look, how dirty you got... Where have you been?

-Let me go back with the others, please. -Calm down!

You don't understand?

It's them who are scared now...

"it's them."

Girls, she's coming back. She's coming back.

I'm sure theyâ€™ll take her back now.

It's a little girl, they won't do anything to her.

Rest now.

-What will we do with so much money? -I know exactly what:

I'm going to get hold of a clear sky blue colour Maserati.

-It's this red car. -How long has it been here?

I don't know.

I don't know well, boss is not here today.

Ah, really?

Your boss told me you know all the cars that are brought in.

How long?

Around 20 days.

-Who brought it? -Foreigner.

From east Europe, not Russian.

Go and bring the gloves and call CSI. Tell them we've got the car.

I understand that the man who left the car showed you his ID.

You issued an invoice for the purchase of the vehicle, didn't you?

-Ticket. -"Da, da." Maybe.

-What do you mean maybe? -أپngel, go to the office and see if you find something, will you?

Yes. Move.

"...no comments about the leak, a conversation in which Inspector Raquel Murillo negotiates with one of the kidnappers, supposedly the ringleader...."

"Inspector."

You!

You!

See who that man is and what's he doing here.

"The Inspector had checkmated most probably.

But even at that moment of desperation, the Professor had kept an extra ball that was starting to be on all the radios."

"The spokesman in the shadow has described as deplorable and shameful that diplomatic relations take precedence over the life of eight Spanish adolescents.

We remind you of the content in the recording."

-Hello. -Tokyo, listen to me.

"The Professor had ordered me to leak the conversation with the Inspector.

A conversation that placed the Spanish Government in a very awkward position and the Inspector herself."

-"All right? -Alison Parker.

Are you sure?

You prefer saving Alison Parker's life to eight students' lives?

Yes, I'm sure."

"Perhaps because Berlin had called him 'softie' and had decided to bang his fist on the table and punish all those who were against him."

"The decision to release Alison Parker, the daughter of the British ambassador, instead of eight Spanish youngsters, has been with no doubt a controversial decision...."

"Or simply that leak started to make us into heroes in the eyes of the general public, but Raquel was like a hound dog."

"...the British ambassador's daughter, Alison Parker...."

"And she had picked up a scent, and one she wouldn't lose, because that scent was

-of the head of the operation." -Stop, Police!

"The Professor himself."

Nothing.

-What are you doing here? -I wasn't stealing.

I...

-What the heck is that smell? -Ammonia.

I wasn't stealing.

"The Professor had become a wretch of a human being to escape, but his performance wasn't ended and more was yet to come to avoid checkmate, and then he did it."

You can go.

It was him.

It was him!

SCRAPYARD CLOSED NO TRESPASSING

"That Sunday, Raquel Murillo missed for just a few seconds, the chance to see the Professor's face.

And that was the last face needed to complete the jig puzzle of the kidnappers and move to the last part of the case.

She already had Rios's face.

Mine.

She was about to have Berlin's.

The Professor had anticipated that Raquel would eventually get those photos.

Like a pack of cards he was sorting out little by little so the Inspector was busy playing with the cards.

His face had to be the only one she would never obtain.

But he wasn't so anonymous, so unknown.

His face was going to start being drawn like a hologram in the police protocols.

The loose end had left him at very high risk.

And now, if the Inspector played her cards right and obtained the Professor's face, the game would be over.

Checkmate would be irreversible."

SUNDAY 12:06 AM

-"Alison Parker. -Are you sure?

Do you prefer saving Alison Parker's life to eight people's lives?

Yes, I'm sure.

How coldblooded she can be, she didn't hesitate.

When someone is capable of making a decision that way, unhesitatingly, one is speechless."

50 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

"That the life of eight Spanish teenagers is less worth than the life of an English girl is outrageous.

Alison Parker is Spanish, she has dual nationality.

Taking into account that the main thing is the hostages, we should think carefully about Inspector Murillo's role.

I don't think she is ready for a matter of this calibre.

She's had an extensive career in the police force.

A psychologist, a criminologist... What more could you ask for?

She has vast experience.

The problem right now is that Inspector Raquel Murillo has just pressed charges for physical abuse."

-Paula! -"What's this got to do with...?

It has to do from the point of view of her being emotionally affected.

Probably, she's under medication, she's unstable..."

She has just talked to her father.

Paula, love, Why don't you tell mummy what daddy told you?

Come on.

If I want to live with him and with my aunt.

And what did you say, darling?

That I will.

Darling, but you know that if you move in with your dad, -we'll see much less of each other. -The same as now. You're never home.

Look, Paula.

Mum doesn't want you to move in with your dad because...

Because your dad isn't good and has hurt me a lot. You understand?

Dad is good.

No, darling, your dad isn't good.

That's not true, dad told me.

He told her that it's a lie. I mean, that you go round talking nonsense.

-I want to live with my aunt. -But, honey.

Look, your aunt Marta is a knucklehead.

I shouldn't be saying this because I'm her mum too.

But her head is made of rag, like your rabbit Eugenio.

Mum.

Enough. Don't turn the child against her aunt, please.

Fine.

Look, darling, You know what we're going to do?

We're going out for a hamburger. Would you like that?

With ketchup?

With ketchup with fries.

And when I finish this job, we're going to the Canaries.

To the beach, a girls' plan. Fancy that?

If it's a girlsâ€™ plan, Iâ€™m in.

Come on, let's go.

And chocolate ice cream too.

Chocolate ice cream, all right. You want chocolate ice cream.

"The questions about this heist, which put us on tenterhooks, are accumulating.

Who are the kidnappers? Is their plan to stay inside?

Do they want money or to protest against financial institutions?

How long can they stay in there without the police deciding to go in?"

Why won't the police go in?

Because we're going to lock the door from inside.

See how she gets pissed.

They won't come in...

because no one in Spain will want them to.

Do you think they're going to hold a referendum?

-Okay. -Let's see.

Year 2011.

A group of young people start to occupy the Puerta del Sol, the most emblematic square in the whole of Spain.

And more than 20,000 people end up gathering there.

15-M, no?

That's the one.

If we had been told, any of us, that 20,000 people would camp on the Puerta del Sol for a month and no police officers were going in, we would have never believed it. We'd have said that itâ€™s impossible.

But it was that way.

And the police didn't go in.

Why?

Because Spain as a whole stood by those youngsters.

Right. But those youngsters had tents and we have guns.

-Somehow different. -That's true.

But politics is politics.

Money is money, isn't it?

Sangria is sangria.

No, no, in Serbia, because of this, police come in.

-"Yibeli", friends. -Don't do that! "Yibili, yibili."

Man! What a pig!

We'll be the Resistance trapped in this rat hole the same way they were the Puerta del Sol Resistance.

And Resistance always has people's support.

-And if that doesn't work... -You have your own audience, don't you?

No, sorry, go on, go on.

Thank you.

If that doesn't work, the police will know we have assault weapons, will know we have explosives.

No elite unit will be able to tell the difference between hostages and robbers.

No Home minister will order the entry, no one.

Why not?

Because there are underage people.

SPANIARDS, SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS

Choosing Alison Parker's life over those eight adolescents' life was your decision.

You told me that the Intelligence Service would assume the consequences.

Go out there and tell the press that it was you and your friends in CNI.

The Intelligence Service cannot make those statements.

But don't worry.

The President's Office is aware of this. You have full support from the Government.

Look, I couldn't care less about the Government's support.

I care about what my daughter and my mother think and not what the President thinks.

Inspector, it was never those people's intention to release Alison Parker nor the eight underage people.

It's a trap.

If you allow me, I'll tell you one thing.

When this is over, no one will remember it.

It's...

It's like Spainâ€™s football team.

It doesn't matter how they do at the beginning of the World Championship.

If you finally get them a happy ending, you'll be the countryâ€™s hero.

If it ends up in a long string of dead people, we'll be screwed up... all of us.

I'm sorry for my mistakes.

And you can fully count on me.

But if you want me to quit...

Suأ،rez, I want everyone working.

I want the forensic tests results on the Seat Ibiza now.

And the report from the Underground Unit. Where is that report, hum?

And, above all, Mr Prieto, I want the Intelligence Service to tell me how the hell those robbers are going to come out.

I have a question, Professor.

How are we coming out of there?

-Through a tunnel. -That's your master plan?

The police will find that out in a couple of minutes.

Yes.

Look.

This is the Fأ،brica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre seen from above.

As soon as you enter, you will make the hostages break the rocks, right here.

In the boiler room in the basement.

It's exactly 13 metres from the sewage system.

13 metres?

At that distance, any GPR system would detect us, wouldn't it?

True.

A GPR system has a 15-metre range.

Or instead, they will use a seismograph that will detect the vibration from the jackhammer.

So, they'll think we'll be escaping through here.

But we're not going to leave through there, are we?

No.

We'll exit through another tunnel.

A tunnel... that they won't be able to see.

Because it is 26 metres from any other drain and, mainly, because it's already there.

We just need to make a hole in order to open it from here, from vault number three.

Who made that tunnel?

-I had it built five years ago. -No...

Once you make the hole to connect the tunnel to the factory, you'll find 486 metres... already excavated to... a hangar

that has already been prepared.

No.

-I take my hat off before you. -And your knickers.

But all the surveillance cameras... the ground has also been sealed, hasn't it?

That's right.

There's a first layer made of steel and a second one of reinforced concrete.

Besides, no pneumatic drill can be used there.

It has to be done by hand, thermal lance, and circular saw.

How many metres?

16 centimetres of steel.

80 centimetres of reinforced concrete.

Finally, soil.

Six metres seventy, in total.

-It's a hell of... -A good hole.

Hey, And... how long will it take you to make that hole?

10, 12 days.

The time we'll be inside here.

Say around...

200 million euros printed per day.

2,400 million.

Yes!

-Come on! -Professor!

The CSI has confirmed traces of ammonia and alcohol on the dashboard, upholstery, windows.

That is, the whole car.

"The lab's chemical report revels that those products were used" a few minutes just before we got there.

What makes us believe that someone related to the gang was there almost at the same time as us.

-"What about the homeless man? -No trace of him."

We have viewed the traffic surveillance cameras and shops nearby, but nothing.

"However, there is some good news."

They were able to isolate one finger print on the button you found inside the Ibiza.

"The owner has previous charges. They are sending us the file."

Attention, listen up everyone.

I need you to leave the tent for a few minutes.

Everyone, except Detective Rubio.

It'll only take a few minutes. Thank you very much.

Thank you.

And except the CNI.

Could it be a coincidence that the guy, "the homeless man, got to the wreck yard before we did?

No, it wasn't a coincidence."

There is mole amongst us.

What are we going to do about it?

Find him.

The police file is here.

Relax.

Relax.

Everything is okay.

Relax.

You rest.

Stay still.

Relax.

Everything is okay.

Everything is okay.

I'll be right back.

It's okay.

No infection. Good.

Very good.

37.6.

There's no problem.

40, a problem.

37.6, no problem.

Me, in the war, look after many men.

Man looks after man.

No problem.

Everything is fine.

Everything is fine.

Mأ³nica.

Mأ³nica, hey.

How are you feeling?

Better.

What are you doing here?

It's my sleep turn, but I just wanted to know how you were doing.

It's hot in here, huh?

Yes.

It feels as there wasn't enough oxygen.

If you want, you can rest here, I'm fine.

I'm fine just sitting down for a little bit.

Fine.

Yes. Yes, yes.

Andrأ©s de Fonollosa.

He has a detention warrant.

Jewellery shops, vans, auction houses.

White collar thefts.

No exit stamps in his electronic passport.

Most probably he has a fake one.

No record of any family or friends either.

The regular informants don't know who he is.

No address, he isn't on any census or registry.

"I can only think of talking to his cell mate.

They shared the same cell in Soto del Real prison.

Do that. Start the paperwork to bring him into the tent."

Wait, wait."

That's not everything. The interesting thing comes from the forensic psychiatry department. Shall I read it for you?

We are before a narcissist, egocentric...

"with delusions of grandeur."

I've gathered you here to tell you a little about how things are going on.

And to put an end to some rumours.

He shows an absolute lack of empathy.

Rumour has it, Ms. Mأ³nica Gaztambide has passed away. This rumour is not good.

Rumours create... uncertainty, anxiety.

That's why I would like to explain it all.

It is true, Ms. Mأ³nica, your colleague, has been executed.

"An eccentric man, with tendency to megalomania which makes him unable" to differentiate evil from good.

But I also want to... share with you some other news.

Good news.

Because the truth... is that this heist... is going very smoothly, on the fast track.

"He has a great sense of honour" and he has a pathological need to make a good impression.

Especially, on strangers.

Therefore, I want to... thank you, I must thank all of you who... are doing your best and collaborating. Especially, one person.

Mr. Torres.

Mr. Torres.

Paco.

Paquito.

Paquito.

Mr Francisco Torres.

This gentleman has been printing banknotes for 27 years.

And today, today he's beaten his own record.

Because, after 40 hours, he's printed...

Tell us how much money you have printed.

311 million euros.

Say it louder, with pride, For everyone to hear it.

311 million.

311 million euros!

311 million euros.

He, alone!

Well, with my colleagues' help, that is.

He's also a humble man. Thank you, Mr. Torres, thank you.

Thank you everyone.

Mr. Torres, do you know what you are?

You are the fucking hostage of the month.

Yes, let's give him the round of applause he deserves.

For Mr. Torres!

Come on!

Come on, so he can see how fond of him we are!

You are a champion.

-So he can feel it. -Thank you!

And now some more good news, I would like you to welcome... how he deserves, and a big round of applause that he will never forget, Mr Arturo.

The CEO, who is finally out of danger!

Thank you, Paco.

Can I have a word with you in private, please?

I want you to leak everything you can about this individual to the press.

What for?

-What for? -Yes.

That bloke is turning this into a fucking show.

As he was in a film.

Let's see what Spain think about him now when everyone sees that an eccentric is holding

-a lot of adolescents hostage. -Raquel.

I doubt you'll win the people's opinion over by saying that the kidnappers' leader is an eccentric.

"This country loves eccentric people.

You'll need more."

Trafficking in women.

An unsolved pimping case.

"Something people can't forgive."

Don't do it. Raquel, donâ€™t do it, don't be so low, donâ€™t do it.

Leak it. A pimp.

In an on-going investigation for trafficking in women from east European countries, some of them, underage girls.

"Released for collaborating with the police.

On top of that, a snitch.

I like your style."

I'm going to the agency to prepare everything.

-Listen. No, listen to me, Raquel.

Are you sure about this, aren't you? We're going to defame a person.

Defame a person?

-Yes. -Yes?

Look, أپngel, my name is on TV talk shows, in the international press as the biggest bitch.

And, casually, my ex-husband has taken this opportunity, at this time of glory to ask my daughter if she wants to move in with him.

Do you know what that means?

He's going to sue me for sole custody of my daughter, that he'll speak to a judge to tell him:

"Your honour, that bitch is not fit to raise my daughter."

"'And, besides, the kid wants to live with me'.

Hey, hey, no judge will grant him sole custody"

-not to someone who physically abused you. -But not even my mother believes me...

-Do you think a judge will believe me? -I believe you, Raquel.

I believe you.

I can testify for you.

-Testify? -Yes.

What will you testify?

-You haven't witnessed anything. -What the hell!

Aren't we going to defame Fonollosa? Here, everyone defames everyone.

Damn! Your husband, the first.

So, I say that... I saw the bruises.

That is, underneath your mini skirt, huh?

But I never wear a mini skirt, أپngel.

It's the same, for godâ€™s sake.

And, at the same time, I can declare about that night we spent in the mountains.

Again, it wasn't in Cercedilla, it was in Miraflores.

"Excuse me, Inspector."

Can I come in?

What's the matter?

We come from the wreck yard. We have questioned the Russian man.

"Nikolai Dimitrevich, the guard.

A man asked about his car an hour before you arrived."

He spoke Russian to him. According to the person's description, "this man could be the same person who spoke with Almansa.

The homeless man."

Bring in the Russian man.

"He can look through the files of delinquents from eastern Europe."

And I want a sketch.

"I want all the files of all the Russians who have been questioned, arrested or accused, okay?"

There is software that helps draw up a sketch here in the tent.

"The image of the Professor was so unknown like an undone jigsaw puzzle of 1,000 pieces.

But a witness was going to put all the pieces together.

And Raquel, who had never believed in sketches, was going to have the key to the whole investigation."

Fuck.

Jessica.

Elena.

Denise.

Paula.

Elisabeth.

Aurora.

And Alison.

I'm sorry I tied you up so tightly.

But, damn, you also stuck a rifle to my head.

What did you expect me to do?

Despite being the ambassador's daughter, you're a bit rebellious, arenâ€™t you?

Not really, it's been the second crazy thing I've done in my life.

Ah, is it? And which was the first one?

Taking ballet lessons behind my father's back.

Blimey, what a crazy thing to do!

Watch out, you start by dancing and end up involved in some fishy stuff, say the violin. And later, going to a rave,

My father has chosen everything for me.

The school, the university studies...

Even the house where I'll study the post grade in Diplomacy in Oxford.

"Alison, this piece of cutlery is for fish.

Alison, not that glass.

Alison, you will sign up for chess."

And the same for everything.

Obviously.

And to piss him off, you take up ballet dancing.

I chose ballet dancing because my father hates ballet.

And volley ball was on Saturdays.

And on Saturdays I can't do anything without him knowing.

Fine.

Take your toiletry bag and up you go in a line.

What were you talking about?

Nothing.

Something about Oxford.

I heard you.

No, about my life. About my father being bossy.

Are you inviting him to the embassy?

Who?

Rio.

No.

Don't you like my boyfriend?

No.

I love his smile.

Don't you?

No.

I've seen you looking at him, why are you lying to me?

Rio is cute, isn't he?

Yes, well.

You see? You like him.

It's fine, admit it.

Yes, I do.

Yes, he's with me.

But I'm not a fierce bitch that goes around biting when she feels insecure.

If you like playing, we'll all have to play, wonâ€™t we?

Off you go.

How long have you been in there?

Three sexual assaults,

six intoxications with narcotics, exhibitionism...

A total of 38 years in prison and still pending for trial, true?

What did you bring me in here for?

You shared the same cell with this man.

Do you remember who he had contact with?

With no one.

Fine, but he must have some relatives.

Girlfriend.

-Partner. -I don't know.

Friends.

He didn't mention.

Are you telling me that he didn't mention anyone in seven months?

What's the matter?

I asked what the matter is.

Did he say anything about his home?

-No. -No?

His neighbourhood, his home town, I don't know, somewhere he was thinking of going back to.

I don't know, he didnâ€™t say anything.

I think you don't quite understand how this works.

I need you to tell me something.

Do you understand?

A clue to help us.

Think, please.

There's something.

What?

I won't tell you for nothing in return.

I've been in prison for four years.

-I need something in return. -Sure.

Let's see, donâ€™t piss me off.

-أپngel. -This isn't a film. No, no.

You tell us something and then, well, we'll see, weâ€™ll come to some arrangement.

You start talking and I'll give you a candy.

-Did you hear me? -أپngel, أپngel!

Relax.

Look here.

I'll sign a form requesting the board of Soto for you to be released on parole.

But under two conditions.

The first one is that you give us the information now.

If the information is good, I'll tell you the second condition.

But you have my word that I'll obtain the parole for you.

He used to inject himself some medicine each day.

I have his infirmary records here, but... it doesn't mention any medical condition.

Yes, I know.

It was something he kept as a secret.

Something degenerative.

Do you remember the name of the medicine?

Retroxil.

How did he obtain it?

I don't know if you are aware that in the prison it's very easy to smuggle anything in.

Inside your anal cavity.

And now tell me what's the second condition.

That you volunteer to undergo a chemical castration treatment.

As soon as you ask for it, I'll sign the form to be released on parole.

-No? -No.

Suأ،rez, take him away.

-Come on. -You gave me your word.

-You fucking bitch! -Come on.

Find out what Retroxil is used for.

Track any strange purchasing patterns in all the pharmacies during the last six months.

If that guy injected himself that every day, "he has had to get himself a big stash before going in."

Only you.

We can't trust anyone before we find the mole.

All right.

I brought the Russian guy in, Inspector.

Nikolai.

I sent for you so you can recognize the man from this morning, in the wreck yard.

Do you think you could recognize his face?

Can you do a sketch?

Perfectly.

أپngel.

"Tell the others they can come back in. Come with me."

Look...

I'm very concerned about my pupil, Silvia.

Because she is... a particularly fragile girl.

And I think she would feel much more protected with the rest of the group, do you know? With her mates.

What subject do you teach in the school, miss?

-Me? -Yes.

I teach...

-Philosophy, Ethics. -Philosophy?

-Yes. -How nice.

History of religions.

-And... Well, some workshops. -What kind of workshops?

About environment, sexual education.

What an important task, isn't it?

And as you're an expert, you may be able to help me to solve a problem I have about sexuality. You see...

Actually, I would like to explain my theory to you.

May I?

Yes, sure.

Tell me.

I came up with it because of jokes.

Jokes.

Jokes.

You know that for a joke to be funny, there has to be some truth... and some pain.

Ah, really? No, I didn't know.

-How curious. -Yes. It's that way.

Do you know the one about the headache?

No.

The husband arrives home.

"Darling, I brought you an aspirin."

And the wife says: "But I haven't got a headache."

"Then let's fuck."

Have you notice the amount of jokes that portray the male figure always trying to break down the female to obtain sex?

And the woman, always obliged, as if she didn't like it.

Do you think that's the truth?

Don't you have the same appetite for sex, miss?

I understand we do.

Perhaps, not as frequently, don't you think?

It could be.

But tell me, Silvia, can I take her with her...?

Ah, of course, Silvia.

Look, stand up a moment, please.

Come with me.

Come.

Look, there she is, Silvia.

You see how relaxed she is?

Hello!

Hello.

Say hello, miss.

I'm sure that itâ€™ll make the little girl happy.

What's the matter, Nairobi?

You are on TV.

Oslo.

It's been a pleasure, miss.

Come again whenever you want. We'll talk about Ethics.

Take her away.

Come with me.

I think this nose.

Almansa.

How is that identikit coming up?

Well, he and I concur with the same features.

-"We'll have his face soon. -Very good."

"Those words made the Professor embark on something he had never imagined he would do.

Look for the police to save his own skin."
